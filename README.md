# SONAR
# Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to classify underwater objects as **Rock** or **Mine** using **SONAR signal data**.  
It is a binary classification problem solved using **Logistic Regression**.

The system analyzes sonar signal frequencies and predicts whether the detected object is dangerous (Mine) or harmless (Rock).

## 📂 Dataset Description
- The dataset consists of **60 numerical features**
- Each feature represents sonar signal energy at different frequencies
- Target labels:
  - `R` → Rock
  - `M` → Mine
